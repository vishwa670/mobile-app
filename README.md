### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd taskflow-mobile-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Mobile Development
```bash
# Add mobile platforms
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android

```

## 📋 Implementation Assumptions

Based on the hackathon requirements, I made the following assumptions:

1. **Authentication**: Implemented local storage instead of social auth for this demo (can be easily integrated with OAuth providers)
2. **Backend**: Used client-side storage for simplicity (ready for backend integration)
3. **Offline Support**: Implemented via local storage (can be enhanced with service workers)
4. **Crash Reporting**: Architecture ready for integration with services like Sentry
5. **Real-time Sync**: Local state management (ready for WebSocket or REST API integration)

## 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Modern Dark Theme**: Professional appearance with carefully chosen colors
- **Gradient Accents**: Subtle gradients for visual depth
- **Micro-Interactions**: Smooth hover effects and state transitions
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and semantic HTML

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

- **React.memo**: Optimized component re-renders
- **useMemo**: Memoized expensive computations
- **Lazy Loading**: Optimized bundle splitting
- **Efficient State Updates**: Minimal re-renders with proper dependency arrays

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Social Authentication**: Google, GitHub, Facebook login integration
- **Backend Integration**: REST API or GraphQL backend
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user task sharing
- **Push Notifications**: Due date and reminder notifications
- **Offline Sync**: Conflict resolution and background sync
- **Advanced Analytics**: Task completion insights and productivity metrics
